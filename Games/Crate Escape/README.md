# Crate Escape
This is a project I made for one of my university course units in year 1  
The code isn't the best but it works and I think the game turned out pretty good

To download, go to the root folder and click Code -> Download ZIP  
You can also just download the .py file and the game will still run without the images folder,  
it will create its own files though so you may want to put it into its own folder  

The menus in the game will explain what to do but the controls and other info are also in a  
comment at the top of the source code  

In the future I would like to remake this game using different libraries (we were forced to use  
tkinter), it was a fun project to work on and I could definitely improve on it
